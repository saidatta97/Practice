1) Ensure GPG keys are configured

Verify GPG keys are configured correctly for your package manager. Depending on the
package management in use one of the following command groups may provide the needed
information:
# rpm -q gpg-pubkey --qf '%{name}-%{version}-%{release} --> %{summary}\n'

2) Ensure loopback traffic is configured

Run the following commands to implement the loopback rules:
# nft add rule inet filter input iif lo accept
# nft create rule inet filter input ip saddr 127.0.0.0/8 counter drop
# nft add rule inet filter input ip6 saddr ::1 counter drop
